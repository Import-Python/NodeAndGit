# NodeAndGit
A portable way of installing Node and Git, with the latest NPM, designed for Electron projects

## Usage
Grab the lastest bat file from [releases](https://github.com/ImportProgram/NodeAndGit/releases), and install away!


## Structure
- NodeGit
  - bin : Folder for all installer files. They don't delete when done. 
  - node (node-??-x64/x32) : Folder for node, with node_modules, where NPM is installed
  - git (git) : It the git client, nothing fancy


## Known Issues:
- Powershell can be annoying weird with downloading files
- The folders in the NodeGit directory sometimes don't get renamed, still can't find the issue for this bug
- Any more, make an issue please
